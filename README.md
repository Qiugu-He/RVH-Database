# Design and Implementation for the RVH Database

## 1. Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) structure/diagram:

## 2. Some created relations with using Oracle:

## 3. Database data:

## 4. SQL statement to meet the user's request:
- In order to access the data for specific user's reuqest, an appropriate SQL is be implemented
- Performance: to speed up a query, an appropriate index is added to appropriate attribute on each table. For example, un-clustered hash index is used on the personeId attritbute of patient relations as the this table is access most frequently. 
An clustered B+ tree index is added on EmployeeID attribute and careCenterId as system requires to show all the employee works at a specific care center.

- System SQL query examples: 
    - View for person (Patient & Employee) info:
        -   CREATE VIEW Persons (pname) 
	        AS SELECT P.pname 
	        FROM Person P
     - View for number of nurses holding an RN certificate, as well as their total and average salary
     	-   CREATE VIEW "NURSE_SUMMARY" ("D", "C", "TOTAL_S", "AVERAGE_S")  
	    AS SELECT Care.cid AS D, COUNT(care_centre_id) C,  
	    SUM(Nur.salary) AS TOTAL_S, AVG(Nur.salary) AS AVERAGE_S 
	    FROM Care_centres Care 
	    INNER JOIN Nurses Nur 
	    ON Care.cid = Nur.care_centre_id 
	    WHERE certificate_type = 'RN' 
	    GROUP BY Care.cid; 
     - View for average salary for each department:
	    -   CREATE VIEW DeptInfo (dept, avgsalary) 
		AS SELECT DISTINCT E.dept, AVG (E.salary) AS avgsalary
		FROM Employee E
		Group by E.dept
    - Privileges granted to user who needs to know only average department salaries for the HR and CS departments
        - The SELECT privileges on VIEW DeptInfo
